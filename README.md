# RedTeamHelp
*UPDATE 1/20/23*
Ghostpack binaries in the active directory section have been cleaned up with confuserex. Deleted alot of old, useless AMSI bypasses. Deleted tools I dont use anymore. Adding shellcode loaders. Added a ton of BOFS. Thanks to Boku,Outflank,mkgeeky,apj500 and all else.


*UPDATE 1/19/23*
This is being restructured like crazy. 99% of these tools are not viable anymore.


Tools I use on red team engagements and more.
ReBuilding VM's Sucks esp for Red Teaming. Im trying to make it a little easier on myself here. Check forks for bigger projects that I use, but was too lazy to import here.
Big thanks to the infosec community. Especially Rasta Mouse and Matt Graeber. A Mix of Community tools, and ones ive written for myself. Thanks for checking it out! Next is figuring out how to auto provision windows attack boxes.
