1. Ghostpack binaries in the Active Directory section have been cleaned up and gone through control flow obfuscation,type scrambling,function obfuscation, anti-debug,antidump measures with confuserex.

2. Deleted alot of old, useless AMSI bypasses as well as tools I dont use anymore.

3. Adding shellcode loaders.

4. Added a ton of BOFS. Thanks to Boku,Outflank,mkgeeky,ajpc500,xForce and all else.

5. Make sure to run the install.sh script.


*UPDATE 1/19/23*
This is being restructured like crazy. 99% of these tools are not viable anymore.


Tools I use on red team engagements and more.
ReBuilding VM's Sucks esp for Red Teaming. Im trying to make it a little easier on myself here. Check forks for bigger projects that I use, but was too lazy to import here.
Big thanks to the infosec community. Especially Rasta Mouse and Matt Graeber. A Mix of Community tools, and ones ive written for myself. Thanks for checking it out! Next is figuring out how to auto provision windows attack boxes.
