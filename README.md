# RedTeamHelp
Tools I use on red team engagements and more.
ReBuilding VM's Sucks esp for Red Teaming. Im trying to make it a little easier on myself here. Check forks for bigger projects that I use, but was too lazy to import here.
Big thanks to the infosec community. Mix of Community tools, and ones ive written for myself. Thanks for checking it out! Next is figuring out how to auto provision windows attack boxes.
